This Expense Tracker was a small project I built to explore and learn different features in the Android Jetpack library. The idea came to me as I was starting my exchange study term in Sweden, and I thought it would be useful to have an app that could store my expenses and quickly show me the total costs converted back to my home currency.

It uses Jetpack Compose for building modern UIs, Room for local persistence, and Hilt for dependency injection. I also integrated Retrofit with the Frankfurter currency API to enable live currency conversion, and added DataStore to persist user preferences such as their home currency.

In the future, I plan to extend this project to allow users to share expenses and collaborate, which could be especially useful for planning group trips.
